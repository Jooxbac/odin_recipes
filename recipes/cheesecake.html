    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A truly delicious proposal that will leave no one indifferent. It can also
      be served on its own, as is, or accompanied by honey or any jam or
      marmalade you have on hand.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>570 g of cream cheese</li>
      <li>4 eggs</li>
      <li>230 g of sugar</li>
      <li>10 g of flour</li>
      <li>285 ml of cream (35% fat)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        First, preheat the oven to 200 ºC. Put 570 g of cream cheese in a large
        bowl and add 4 eggs, one at a time.
      </li>
      <li>Stir and mix well with a whisk after each egg has been added.</li>
      <li>
        Then add 230 g sugar and again homogenise the mixture with the aid of
        our whisk.
      </li>
      <li>
        Then add 10 g of flour and stir again with the whisks, integrating the
        mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Finally, add 285 ml of cream and once again, stir well and integrate all
        the ingredients.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the mixture is ready, crumple up a sheet of baking paper and wet it
        a little to make it easier to place in the mould. After this, we stretch
        the sheet with our hands, shake it a little to remove the excess water
        and place it on the mould.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the cheese mixture into the baking tin with the parchment paper
        already in place.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the baking tin in the oven at 200 ºC, with heat up and down, and
        on a medium-low oven rack. Bake for 40 minutes, until the surface takes
        on a characteristic golden colour.
      </li>
      <li>
        After the corresponding baking time has elapsed, remove the mould from
        the oven. After about 2 hours out of the oven, the cake will have
        reached the perfect texture. After the resting time, carefully remove
        the parchment paper from the edges and serve or keep refrigerated.
      </li>
    </ol>
