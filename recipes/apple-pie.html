    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A dessert for those that want to experiment the sweetness of the apples in
      another way.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 puff pastry sheet</li>
      <li>400 g of apples</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>55 g of peach jam</li>
      <li>20 g of brown sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Roll out the puff pastry. Make a cut with a knife around the dough about
        2 cm from the edge. Prick the dough with a fork, except for the edge.
      </li>
      <li>Extract the core, peel and thinly slice the apples. Spread 35 g of jam over the puff pastry and arrange the apples in three rows.</li>
      <li>Brush the edge with beaten egg and sprinkle the brown sugar all over the apple tart. Bake for about 20 minutes.</li>
      <li>Take the apple tart out of the oven and brush with the remaining marmalade that has been slightly heated in the microwave (if it is too thick, add a little water).</li>
